# Translation Reference Files

These JSON files are **reference guides** for manual translation. They contain all the text content from the website organized by section.

## How to Use:

1. **For translators:** Use these files as a clean reference of what text needs to be translated
2. **For developers:** Copy translations from JSON into the respective HTML files manually
3. **For quality control:** Compare your HTML translations against these JSON files

## Files:

- `en.json` - English (base language)
- `it.json` - Italian (already translated and implemented)
- `es.json` - Spanish (reference for manual translation)
- `fr.json` - French (reference for manual translation)

## Workflow:

1. Send JSON files to translator
2. Receive translated JSON back
3. Manually copy translations into HTML files
4. Use JSON to verify all content was translated

**Note:** These files are NOT loaded by JavaScript. They are purely for organization and reference.
